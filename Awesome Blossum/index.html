            <h1>Awesome Blossom</h1>
			<h5>Awesome Blossom was started in the summer of 2008 following the birth of my daughter Rebecca in January. My daughter was very ill and required hospitalization for the first 6 months of her life.
							 To keep busy at her bedside I would read or craft and I really got into scrapbooking at one time.
							One day I was scapbooking with flowers and Rebecca happened to be in my line of sight so that the flower looked like it was on her head, it was an ah-ha moment. 
						That day I made Rebecca a flowered head band, the next day I made 3 more for the girls in our pod and by the end of the week all the little girls in our unit had one.
					It was so delightful and cheery and Awesome Blossom was born.
